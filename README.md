EcoSwap App
EcoSwap is an Android application that facilitates users to swap goods in an eco-friendly and sustainable way. Users can list products they want to swap, browse products from other users, and send or accept swap requests. The app allows users to view details of products and contact other users directly for further negotiation. It also integrates location-based services to display nearby products and enable seamless communication.

Features
1. User Authentication
Users can sign up and log in using their email/password or third-party authentication (e.g., Google or Facebook).

2. Product Listing and Browsing
Users can list their products for swap by providing details such as title, description, images, and category.

Users can browse products from other users, filtered by categories or proximity based on their location.

3. Swap Request System
Users can send a swap request for a product they are interested in.

The recipient user can either accept or reject the swap request.

4. Real-time Chat System
Once a swap request is accepted, a chat room is created between the users, allowing them to communicate directly in real-time.

5. Nearby Products
Products listed by users are displayed based on their proximity to the user's current location, calculated using geographic coordinates.

6. Contact Information
After a swap request is accepted, users can view the other userâ€™s contact information, such as their phone number, email, and address.

7. Call Functionality
Users can directly call the other user by clicking a "Call" button in the app, which opens the default dialer with the other user's phone number pre-filled.
