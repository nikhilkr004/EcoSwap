Problem Statement
❓Problem:
India faces increasing waste generation and poor waste segregation practices
in both urban and rural settings. Usable goods (books, clothes, electronics,
furniture) often end up in landfills due to lack of awareness and a streamlined
reuse/recycle platform.
Proposed Solution – EcoSwap
✅What is EcoSwap?
A mobile platform where users can:
 Donate, exchange, or request reusable goods
 Recycle responsibly with pickup or drop-off info
 Earn EcoPoints for sustainable behavior
 Connect locally with others in a campus, urban society, or smart village
